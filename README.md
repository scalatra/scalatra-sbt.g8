# Scalatra sbt project #

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/scalatra/scalatra-sbt.g8.png)](http://travis-ci.org/scalatra/scalatra-sbt.g8)


Use [g8](http://github.com/n8han/giter8) template to get a Scalatra web service up and running quickly.

## About this template ##

This template is forked from :  [scalatra/scalatra-sbt.g8](https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra-sbt.g8). If you would like to refer to original project, please check that link as well.

## What was changed ##

1. After forked, I added sub projects (domainTier, dataTier, common) three layers.

The purpose of layering is to separate the presentation layer out of the project.
We should have better domain/data layer to avoid cross reference in project as well.

2. Use jetty for sandbox testing. In Jetty, configure it to run in debug mode, listen on port 5005.
